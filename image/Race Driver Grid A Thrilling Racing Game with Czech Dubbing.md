But what if you prefer to play the game in Czech? Well, you are in luck, because there is a Czech dubbing mod for Race Driver Grid that adds almost complete Czech voice-over to the game. You can hear the drivers, the commentators, and the crew members speak in Czech, which adds more immersion and realism to the game[^1^].
 
However, there are some drawbacks to this mod. Some cutscenes are not dubbed in Czech, such as the 24 hours le Mans event. Also, when you search for online servers, you cannot see the table of available games, so you have to join them blindly. But these are minor issues compared to the quality of the dubbing, which is worth trying if you love the game[^1^].
 
So, how can you install this mod? It's very simple. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Download the mod from this link: [http://www.i-play.hys.cz/?p=41](http://www.i-play.hys.cz/?p=41)
