## What is an Elicenser Activation Code?
 
An Elicenser Activation Code is a unique code that allows you to download and activate a license for a Steinberg product, such as Cubase 7. You can obtain an Elicenser Activation Code from different sources, depending on how you purchased your software:
 
- If you bought your software in a box, it includes a Download Access Code printed on a sheet (Essential Product License Information). When you redeem the Download Access Code in the Steinberg Download Assistant, an Elicenser Activation Code will be automatically generated and used to download and activate your license.
- If you bought your software as a download from the online shop, you received a confirmation email with either an Elicenser Activation Code or a Download Access Code. If you have a Download Access Code, you need to redeem it in the Steinberg Download Assistant to get your Elicenser Activation Code.
- If you need to reactivate your software after changing your computer or operating system, you can request an Elicenser Activation Code from your MySteinberg account.
- If you have an older version of Cubase LE, Cubase AI, or WaveLab LE, you can get an Elicenser Activation Code by registering your software online in your MySteinberg account.
